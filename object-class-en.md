# Class / Object #

#### In terms of "Class" ####
Class is what you can call it as "Blueprint", prepared to be used to create objects with 2 things inside class itself  
1. Property - Describe what class can contain data inside itself that means class can have multiple variables and objects inside itself, which can be just integer and boolean or another class's object, it can be private or public variables
2. Method - Describe what class can do with/without the property inside itself, method can just return static result or calculate the values inside properties



Python itself is an object oriented programming language, so most of all variables you use in python, they are created by "Class" except primitive variables such as integer, short, boolean, float, etc.
